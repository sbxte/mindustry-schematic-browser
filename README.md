Implementation taken from [Foo's Client](https://github.com/mindustry-antigrief/mindustry-client/)

## Building for Desktop Testing

1. Install JDK **17**.
2. Run `gradlew jar` [1].
3. Your mod jar will be in the `build/libs` directory. **Only use this version for testing on desktop. It will not work with Android.**
To build an Android-compatible version, you need the Android SDK. You can either let Github Actions handle this, or set it up yourself. See steps below.

## Building Locally

Building locally takes more time to set up, but shouldn't be a problem if you've done Android development before.
1. Download the Android SDK, unzip it and set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to its location.
2. Make sure you have API level 30 installed, as well as any recent version of build tools (e.g. 30.0.1)
3. Add a build-tools folder to your PATH. For example, if you have `30.0.1` installed, that would be `$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/30.0.1`.
4. Run `gradlew deploy`. If you did everything correctlly, this will create a jar file in the `build/libs` directory that can be run on both Android and desktop.
